        <h1>Cherry Pie</h1>

        <p>
            Dale Cooper:<br />
            Diane, 7:30 am, February twenty-fourth. Entering town of Twin Peaks.<br />
             Five miles south of the Canadian border, twelve miles west of the state line.<br /> 
             Never seen so many trees in my life. As W.C. Fields would say, I'd rather be here than Philadelphia.<br />
             It's fifty-four degrees on a slightly overcast day. Weatherman said rain.<br />
             If you could get paid that kind of money for being wrong sixty percent of the time it'd beat working.<br />
             Mileage is 79,345, gauge is on reserve, I'm riding on fumes here, I've got to tank up when I get into town.<br />
             Remind me to tell you how much that is. Lunch was $6.31 at the Lamplighter Inn.<br />
             That's on Highway Two near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna fish sandwich on whole wheat,<br /> 
             a slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee. Damn good food. <br />
             Diane, if you ever get up this way, that cherry pie is worth a stop.    
             <br />

                <li>8 ounces/227 grams (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/2-inch (12 millimeter) cubes</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>¼ cup/60 milliliters whole milk </li>
                <li>Raw sugar, for sprinkling </li>
                                
            </ul>
            <h4>For the filling: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>8 cups/38 ounces/1,100 grams pitted sour cherries, fresh or frozen</li>
                <li>1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar (see tip)</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons/36 grams cornstarch</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons cherry liqueur or cherry-flavored brandy</li>
                                         
            </ul>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the crust: In a liquid measuring cup, stir together the milk and vinegar. In a large mixing bowl, toss the flour, sugar and salt with a fork to combine. Using a pastry cutter, cut in the butter cubes until the butter is the size of small peas. Using a fork or large spoon, slowly add the liquid in 4 or 5 additions, stopping after every pour to combine, until the dough just sticks together. Knead lightly in the bowl until it forms a taut ball.</li>
                <li>Separate dough into 2 equal-size disks and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least an hour. (Dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 2 months.)</li>
                <li>Make the filling: Mix the cherries, sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium-size saucepan and cook over medium heat until cherries thaw (if frozen) and the cornstarch and sugar dissolve. Reduce heat to medium-low, stirring occasionally to keep cherries from burning, and cook until the mixture thickens slightly. (Total cooking time should be about 20 minutes.) Add liqueur, stir and remove from heat. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Assemble the pie: Heat oven to 425 degrees. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out 1 disk of dough into a 1/8-inch (3 millimeters) thick circle about 15 inches (38 centimeters) in diameter. Transfer to a 9-inch/23 centimeter deep-dish pie plate and chill in refrigerator as you work on the top crust.</li>
                <li>Working quickly, roll out a second disk into an 1/8-inch (3 millimeters) thick rectangle about 15 inches (38 centimeters) long and 12 inches (30 centimeters) wide. Cut into 6 strips about 2 inches (5 centimeters) wide. Remove pie plate from refrigerator and fill with cherry filling. Weave lattice strips over the top. Seal, trim and crimp the edges. Or cut dough into five zigzag strips and lay on top of pie filling, trimming excess.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, whisk the egg and milk to make an egg wash. Brush the crust with it, and sprinkle with raw sugar.</li>
                <li>On a baking sheet, bake pie for 20 minutes at 425 degrees, rotating once halfway through. Lower heat to 350 degrees and bake another 30 to 40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is thick and glossy. Juice may bubble onto baking sheet. Remove pie to wire rack to cool before serving. The pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
            </ol>

                Tip
                <br /><br />
                Buy sour cherries when they are in season and pit them the same day you buy them. Mix 4 cups/550 grams pitted sour cherries with 1/2 cup/100 grams sugar and freeze in a zipper-lock bag. For this recipe, you would use 2 bags of these frozen cherries without adding the sugar on the ingredient list. The cherries will keep, frozen, for up to 2 years.
